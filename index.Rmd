## Goals

> 1. Introduce a powerful statistical tool
> 2. Explore visualization options
> 3. How they can be used for our organization

## Flow

> 1. R as a language
> 2. Why data analysis
> 3. Projects (done and possibilities)
> 4. Q/A and discussion

---

## What is R?

> 1. Used by statistics researchers (made by statisticians initially)
> 2. Flexible
> 3. Freeware *http://www.r-project.org*
> 4. [Widespread](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/companies-using-r)
> 4. Repository [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)
> 5. Platform independent
> 6. Most common editor - [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
> 7. Handling data is easy (Vector, Matrix, Dataframe, List)
> 8. Connects with other languages, applications and databases easily
> 9. Highly engaged community - [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

## Amore Operations Dashboard

- ggplot2: once the standard of graphs
- ggvis: to replace ggplot2
- Tables
- shiny: Multiple tabs
- Analyse large data in a matter of seconds

---

## Abbott AMS

- googleVis: Uses Google Charts to Visualize 
- Combined with Shiny options to create flexibility

---

## Amore Batch Picking list
